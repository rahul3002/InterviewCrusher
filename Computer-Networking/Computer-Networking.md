# Computer Network Types

Regardless of your systemâ€™s purpose, it will need a connection protocol to link all devices. This link can be via Ethernet (Local Area Network), WLAN (Wi-Fi), or WAN (Wide Area Network). Each has risks and benefits to consider when deciding which connection type use

# Ethernet (Wired LAN)

- Centralized wired connection between local devices via ethernet cables.
- Faster connection than via wireless.
- Difficult/costly to upgrade the Ethernet speed category once installed.
- Limited distance due to wired requirement.

# WLAN (Wi-Fi)

- Local wireless network connection to a shared Ethernet wired relay.
- Devices can be mobile within the network area.
- Devices can be added or removed from the network seamlessly.
- Not secure; prone to snooping and cyber-attacks.

# WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Similar to LAN but on a wider scale; connects multiple local networks.
- Devices in one LAN network can communicate with those in other connected - LAN networks through pre-configured routers.
- Highly scalable.
- Longer latency based on the system scale.
- Hard to secure, more accessible by outside system forces.

# Cloud Networking

Another newer computer network type is Cloud Networking, which allows developers to connect many devices across a huge geographical area using cloud-based wireless networking systems hosted by third-party service providers. This type is quickly gaining popularity among tech firms due to its cheap execution and versatility.

- Versatile, suited for any business type or scale
- Faster speeds than traditional network types due to the number of cloud servers
- Cheap, lower cost than businesses constructing and managing their own network hardware
- Only accessible with an internet connection
- Often targeted by cyberattacks
