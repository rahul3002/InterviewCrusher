- Operating systems are the foundation of modern digital devices. 
- These systems determine how you see and interact with your machines.
- Operating systems determine how we program an application, 
- what software we can use, and how hardware should be designed. 
- Understanding operating systems is essential for developers to ensure designing programs that work to the strengths of a particular operating system.
